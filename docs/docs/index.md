Build and edit Agent Studio projects locally with the **PolyAI ADK**, then push them back to Agent Studio to review and deploy.

The ADK gives you a local, Git-like workflow for Agent Studio projects: pull, edit with standard tooling, validate, and push.

## From zero to a local project

A few commands take you from an empty machine to a working local copy of your agent:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # install uv (skip if you have it)
uv venv --python=3.14 --seed
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install polyai-adk
poly start                                          # self-serve sign-up, API key, and project in one go
```

`poly start` is for self-serve accounts on [studio.poly.ai](https://studio.poly.ai). If your workspace is on an enterprise cluster (`us-1`, `euw-1`, `uk-1`), run `poly login --region <region>` instead — or export your API key manually. See [Getting started](get-started/get-started.md#enterprise-accounts-poly-login-or-manual-api-key).

See [Getting started](get-started/get-started.md) for the full walkthrough, [Prerequisites](get-started/prerequisites.md) for local tool setup, and [First commands](get-started/first-commands.md) for a guide to `poly init` and the core CLI.

## What this site covers

This documentation follows the developer journey:

- understanding what the ADK is and how it fits into Agent Studio
- installing it and running the first commands
- building, reviewing, and deploying agents
- reference for all CLI commands, resource types, and tooling

## Recommended path

If you are new to the ADK, follow this order:

1. follow **Getting started** — install the ADK, set up your API key (`poly start` for self-serve, `poly login` or a manual export for enterprise), and create your first project
2. read **What is the PolyAI ADK?**
3. use **First commands** — explore the core CLI commands
4. continue to **Build an agent with the ADK**
