# Agent settings

<p class="lead">
Agent settings define the agent's identity and behavioral rules.
They live in <code>agent_settings/</code> and are made up of personality, role, and rules resources.
</p>

!!! note "Personality and role are platform-provisioned — update only"
    The personality and role resources are created automatically by the platform when a project is created. They always exist on any Agent Studio project and can be updated with `poly push`, but cannot be created from scratch via the ADK. If these files appear in a project directory without matching entries in `.agent_studio_config` — for example, after copying a directory from another project — the push will fail with a "Create operation not supported" error. Always start a new project with [`poly init`](./cli.md#poly-init) and [`poly pull`](./cli.md#poly-pull) rather than copying an existing directory.

These settings shape how the agent presents itself and how it should behave across the conversation.

## Location

Agent settings live under:

~~~text
agent_settings/
├── personality.yaml
├── role.yaml
├── rules.txt
├── safety_filters.yaml             # Optional
└── experimental_config.json        # Optional

## What agent settings control

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **Personality**

    ---

    Controls the agent's tone and conversational style.

-   **Role**

    ---

    Defines what the agent is and what kind of job it performs.

-   **Rules**

    ---

    Provides plain-text instructions the agent should follow on every turn.

-   **Safety filters**

    ---

    Project-level content safety filtering across four categories.

-   **Experimental config**

    ---

    Optional advanced feature flags and tuning.

## Personality

The `personality.yaml` file controls the agent's conversational tone.

### Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `adjectives` | Map of personality traits to booleans |
| `custom` | Free-text personality description |

### Adjectives

Allowed adjective values are:

- `Polite`
- `Calm`
- `Kind`
- `Funny`
- `Energetic`
- `Thoughtful`
- `Other`

If `Other` is set to `true`, no other adjective can be selected.

!!! info "Non-standard adjectives"

    The platform may return adjectives not in the local allowed set (for example, deprecated or newly added adjectives). Validation only fails for adjectives that are **enabled** (`true`) and not in the allowed set. Disabled (`false`) non-standard adjectives pass validation and are silently excluded from the update payload when pushing.

### `custom`

The `custom` field is a free-text description of the personality.

It supports:

- `{{attr:...}}`
- `{{vrbl:...}}`

### Example

~~~yaml
adjectives:
  Polite: true
  Calm: true
  Kind: true
custom: ""
~~~

## Role

The `role.yaml` file defines what the agent is.

This is usually the agent's role, title, or function in the business context.

### Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `value` | Role name, such as `Customer Service Representative` |
| `additional_info` | Extra context about the role |
| `custom` | Free-text role description used when `value` is `other` |

If `value` is set to `other`, the `custom` field is used instead.

The `custom` field supports:

- `{{attr:...}}`
- `{{vrbl:...}}`

### Example

~~~yaml
value: Customer Service Representative
additional_info: Handles customer inquiries and bookings
custom: ""
~~~

## Rules

The `rules.txt` file contains plain-text behavioral instructions that the agent should follow on every turn.

This is one of the most important files for shaping agent behavior.

### Supported references

The rules file supports the following references:

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{{fn:function_name}}` | [Global function](./functions.md) |
| `{{twilio_sms:template_name}}` | [SMS template](./sms.md) |
| `{{ho:handoff_name}}` | [Handoff destination](./handoffs.md) |
| `{{attr:attribute_name}}` | [Variant attribute](./variants.md) |
| `{{vrbl:variable_name}}` or `$variable_name` | [State variable](./variables.md) |

### Example

~~~text
Be helpful and professional at all times.
Use {{fn:validate_email}} when the user provides an email address.
For complex issues, use {{ho:escalation_handoff}} to transfer to a specialist.
Send confirmation via {{twilio_sms:confirmation_template}} after booking.
~~~

## Writing effective rules

Rules are most useful when they are:

- concise
- explicit
- actionable
- stable across turns

Good rules tell the agent what standard it should follow, not how to perform step-by-step branching logic.

!!! tip "Use rules for behavioral guidance"

    Rules are a good place for durable operating principles such as escalation behavior, safety guidance, or how the agent should handle common classes of requests.

## What not to put in rules

Avoid putting deterministic branching logic into `rules.txt`.

### Avoid

- long conditional logic chains
- step-by-step routing logic
- hard-coded values that should come from references

For example, do not write logic such as:

~~~text
If $x == 0 do A, else do B.
~~~

That kind of logic belongs in flows and Python functions.

### Prefer

- references such as `{{fn:...}}`, `{{attr:...}}`, and `{{vrbl:...}}`
- concise instructions that apply broadly
- deterministic logic handled in code or flow transitions

## Safety filters

The `safety_filters.yaml` file configures project-level content safety filtering. It controls whether harmful content is filtered across all channels by default.

See the [Safety filters reference](./safety_filters.md) for field descriptions, schema, and examples.

## Best practices

- keep rules concise and actionable
- use references instead of hard-coded values
- use `custom` personality and role text only when you need more than the structured fields provide
- treat rules as a global behavioral layer, not a place for detailed flow logic
