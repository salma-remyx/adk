# Getting started

The fastest way to get up and running is entirely from the command line. Two steps — install the ADK, then authenticate — take you from an empty machine to a local project you can edit, push, and deploy.

---

## Step 1 — Install the ADK

You need **uv** to manage the Python environment. If you already have it, skip the first line.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # or: brew install uv
```

Then create a virtual environment and install the ADK:

```bash
uv venv --python=3.14 --seed
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install polyai-adk
```

Confirm it worked:

```bash
poly --help
```

!!! info "Suppress SyntaxWarnings from platform-generated code"

    Platform-generated code uses regex patterns (such as `\d`) that trigger `SyntaxWarning` in Python 3.14's stricter string handling. This produces 40+ warning lines on every `poly` command and obscures normal output.

    To suppress them, set this before running any `poly` command:

    ```bash
    export PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore
    ```

!!! tip "Optional — install the VS Code / Cursor extension"

    If you plan to work in **VS Code** or **Cursor**, you can also install the [PolyAI ADK extension](../reference/tooling.md#polyai-adk-extension-for-vs-code-and-cursor) for resource-aware editing on top of the CLI. The extension is additive — the `poly` command remains the source of truth for every workflow.

## Step 2 — Sign in and set up your API key

The right command depends on whether you are a new user or an existing enterprise user.

### New users — `poly start`

```bash
poly start
```

`poly start` is designed for users creating a new Agent Studio account. It handles everything in one flow:

1. **Sign up or sign in** — opens a browser window for authentication. This can be on any device, not just the machine running the CLI.
2. **API key** — generates a key and saves it to `~/.poly/credentials.json`. Future `poly` commands pick it up automatically — no environment variables to manage.
3. **Create a project** — optionally creates a new Agent Studio project and pulls it down locally so you can start editing immediately.

!!! tip "Already have an account?"
    If `poly start` detects an existing API key (from the credential file or an environment variable), it skips authentication and goes straight to project creation.

### Existing enterprise users — `poly login`

If you already have an Agent Studio account and need to authenticate against a specific region (for example, `us-1`, `uk-1`, or `euw-1`), use `poly login` instead:

```bash
poly login
poly login --region us-1
```

`poly login` opens a browser window for authentication, then saves your API key credentials to `~/.poly/credentials.json`. If you omit `--region`, you are prompted to select one interactively.

| Region flag | Use |
|---|---|
| `poly login` | Prompted to select region interactively |
| `poly login --region studio` | Authenticate against Agent Studio (default region) |
| `poly login --region us-1` | Authenticate against the US enterprise region |
| `poly login --region uk-1` | Authenticate against the UK enterprise region |
| `poly login --region euw-1` | Authenticate against the EU West enterprise region |

??? note "Manual API key setup"

    If you prefer to manage API keys through the Agent Studio UI:

    1. Log in to [Agent Studio](https://studio.poly.ai) and open your workspace.
    2. In the **API Keys** tab (next to the **Users** tab), click **+ API key**.

    ![Generating an API key in Agent Studio — API Keys tab with the + API key button highlighted](../assets/api-key-data-access.png)

    Then export the key:

    ```bash
    export POLY_ADK_KEY=<your-api-key>
    ```

    To make it permanent, add the export line to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`).

!!! info "How the ADK resolves API keys"
    The ADK checks for credentials in the following order:

    1. **Credential file** — `~/.poly/credentials.json` (written by `poly start` or `poly login`)
    2. **Region-specific env var** — e.g. `POLY_ADK_KEY_US`
    3. **General env var** — `POLY_ADK_KEY`

    The first match wins. If nothing is found, the CLI raises an error.

    If you work across multiple regions, you can set region-scoped variables. See [per-region API keys](#per-region-api-keys) below.

## Step 3 — Start building

If `poly start` created a project for you, `cd` into the project directory. Otherwise, connect to an existing project:

```bash
poly init
```

[`poly init`](../reference/cli.md#poly-init) walks you through interactive dropdowns to pick a region, account, and project, then pulls the configuration locally.

From inside your project directory, the core workflow is:

```bash
poly status              # see what's changed
poly diff                # inspect changes in detail
poly branch create dev   # work on a branch
poly push                # push changes to Agent Studio
poly chat                # talk to your agent
```

Edit flows, functions, topics, and other resources in your editor of choice — they're just YAML and Python files. Push when you're ready to test in Agent Studio.

## Seed an agent from your website

If you're starting from scratch and want a working baseline, you can generate an agent from your company website inside Agent Studio. This gives you topics and agent settings pre-populated from your site's public content — a useful starting point before building locally.

1. Open [Agent Studio](https://studio.poly.ai) and sign in (your `poly start` account works here).
2. Click **+ Agent** → **Quick Agent Setup**.
3. Enter your website URL and click **Create agent**.

![Quick setup button Agent Studio](../assets/quick-agent-setup.png)

Agent Studio crawls your site and generates a configuration — usually within a few minutes. Once it's ready, pull it into your local project:

```bash
poly pull
```

!!! tip "What gets generated"

    Agent Studio populates **topics** (knowledge base entries) and basic **agent settings** (personality, role, rules) from your website's public content. It does not generate flows, variants, entities, handoffs, or integrations — those are for you to build locally with the ADK.

---

## Already have an agent in Agent Studio?

If you have an existing project — built in the browser, by a PolyAI team, or by any other method — connect it to the ADK in two commands:

```bash
poly login    # sign in and save your API key (use poly start for new accounts)
poly init     # interactive prompts to pick region, account, and project
```

`poly init` creates a local directory and pulls the full project configuration. From there the standard `poly status` / `poly push` / `poly pull` workflow applies.

---

## Per-region API keys

If you work across multiple regions, you can set region-scoped environment variables. The ADK checks the credential file first, then region-scoped env vars, then `POLY_ADK_KEY`.

| Region | Environment variable |
|---|---|
| `us-1` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_US` |
| `euw-1` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_EUW` |
| `uk-1` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_UK` |
| `studio` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_STUDIO` |
| `staging` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_STAGING` |
| `dev` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_DEV` |

```bash
export POLY_ADK_KEY_US=<your-us-api-key>
export POLY_ADK_KEY=<your-fallback-api-key>   # used for any other region
```
