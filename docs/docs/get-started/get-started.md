# Getting started

The fastest way to get up and running is entirely from the command line. Two steps — install the ADK, then sign in — take you from an empty machine to a local project you can edit, push, and deploy. Sign-in uses `poly start` (self-serve) or `poly login` (enterprise), described below.

---

## Step 1 — Install the ADK

You need **uv** to manage the Python environment. If you already have it, skip the first line.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # or: brew install uv
```

Then create a virtual environment and install the ADK:

```bash
uv venv --python=3.14 --seed
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install polyai-adk
```

Confirm it worked:

```bash
poly --help
```

!!! info "Suppress SyntaxWarnings from platform-generated code"

    Platform-generated code uses regex patterns (such as `\d`) that trigger `SyntaxWarning` in Python 3.14's stricter string handling. This produces 40+ warning lines on every `poly` command and obscures normal output.

    To suppress them, set this before running any `poly` command:

    ```bash
    export PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore
    ```

!!! tip "Optional — install the VS Code / Cursor extension"

    If you plan to work in **VS Code** or **Cursor**, you can also install the [PolyAI ADK extension](../reference/tooling.md#polyai-adk-extension-for-vs-code-and-cursor) for resource-aware editing on top of the CLI. The extension is additive — the `poly` command remains the source of truth for every workflow.

## Step 2 — Sign in and set up your API key

The right setup path depends on the type of Agent Studio account you have:

- **Self-serve accounts** (signed up at [studio.poly.ai](https://studio.poly.ai)) — use [`poly start`](#self-serve-accounts-poly-start) for an end-to-end setup that creates an account, an API key, and an optional first project.
- **Enterprise accounts** (a workspace provisioned by PolyAI on a regional cluster such as `us-1`, `euw-1`, or `uk-1`) — use [`poly login --region <region>`](#enterprise-accounts-poly-login-or-manual-api-key) to sign in through your browser, or create an API key in the Agent Studio UI and [export it manually](#manual-api-key-export). `poly start` is self-serve only and does not work against enterprise clusters.

If you're not sure which you have, your PolyAI contact can confirm.

### Self-serve accounts — `poly start`

```bash
poly start
```

`poly start` handles everything you need to authenticate:

1. **Sign up or sign in** — opens a browser window for authentication. This can be on any device, not just the machine running the CLI.
2. **API key** — generates a key and saves it to `~/.poly/credentials.json`. Future `poly` commands pick it up automatically — no environment variables to manage.
3. **Create a project** — optionally creates a new Agent Studio project and pulls it down locally so you can start editing immediately.

!!! tip "Already have a self-serve account?"
    If `poly start` detects an existing API key (from the credential file or an environment variable), it asks whether to keep using it — accept and you skip straight to the project creation step. Decline and it runs the full sign-in flow again.

### Enterprise accounts — `poly login` or manual API key { #enterprise-accounts-poly-login-or-manual-api-key }

Enterprise workspaces have two options. `poly login` is the quickest path for most users; the manual export is the fallback if you can't authenticate through the browser (for example, on a CI runner).

#### Option 1 — `poly login` (recommended)

```bash
poly login --region us-1   # or euw-1, uk-1
```

`poly login`:

1. Opens a browser window so you can sign in to your enterprise workspace.
2. Fetches (or creates) an API key for your user.
3. Saves it to `~/.poly/credentials.json` under the region you specified, so future `poly` commands pick it up automatically.

If you omit `--region`, the CLI prompts you to pick one. To sign in to more than one region from the same machine, re-run `poly login` with each region — the credential file stores them side by side.

#### Option 2 — Manual API key export { #manual-api-key-export }

If you'd rather create the key yourself in the Agent Studio UI:

1. Log in to Agent Studio for your region and open your workspace.
2. In the **API Keys** tab (next to the **Users** tab), click **+ API key**.

![Generating an API key in Agent Studio — API Keys tab selected, showing the + API key button in the top-right](../assets/api-keys-tab.png)

Then export the key:

```bash
export POLY_ADK_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

To make it permanent, add the export line to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`). If you work across more than one region, use the region-scoped variables in [per-region API keys](#per-region-api-keys) below.

!!! info "How the ADK resolves API keys"
    The ADK checks for credentials in the following order:

    1. **Credential file** — `~/.poly/credentials.json` (written by `poly start` or `poly login`)
    2. **Region-specific env var** — e.g. `POLY_ADK_KEY_US`
    3. **General env var** — `POLY_ADK_KEY`

    The first match wins. If nothing is found, the CLI raises an error.

## Step 3 — Start building

If `poly start` created a project for you, `cd` into the project directory. Otherwise, connect to an existing project:

```bash
poly init
```

[`poly init`](../reference/cli.md#poly-init) walks you through interactive dropdowns to pick a region, account, and project, then pulls the configuration locally.

From inside your project directory, the core workflow is:

```bash
poly status              # see what's changed
poly diff                # inspect changes in detail
poly branch create dev   # work on a branch
poly push                # push changes to Agent Studio
poly chat                # talk to your agent
```

Edit flows, functions, topics, and other resources in your editor of choice — they're just YAML and Python files. Push when you're ready to test in Agent Studio.

## Seed an agent from your website

If you're starting from scratch and want a working baseline, you can generate an agent from your company website inside Agent Studio. This gives you topics and agent settings pre-populated from your site's public content — a useful starting point before building locally.

1. Open [Agent Studio](https://studio.poly.ai) for self-serve, or your region's URL for enterprise, and sign in with the same account you authenticated with above.
2. Click **+ Agent** → **Quick Agent Setup**.
3. Enter your website URL and click **Create agent**.

![Quick setup button Agent Studio](../assets/quick-agent-setup.png)

Agent Studio crawls your site and generates a configuration — usually within a few minutes. Once it's ready, pull it into your local project:

```bash
poly pull
```

!!! tip "What gets generated"

    Agent Studio populates **topics** (knowledge base entries) and basic **agent settings** (personality, role, rules) from your website's public content. It does not generate flows, variants, entities, handoffs, or integrations — those are for you to build locally with the ADK.

---

## Already have an agent in Agent Studio?

If you have an existing project — built in the browser, by a PolyAI team, or by any other method — connect it to the ADK with `poly init` once your API key is set up:

```bash
# Self-serve accounts:
poly start                       # sign in and save your API key (skip if already done)
poly init                        # interactive prompts to pick region, account, and project

# Enterprise accounts (poly login — recommended):
poly login --region us-1         # or euw-1, uk-1
poly init

# Enterprise accounts (manual key export, fallback):
export POLY_ADK_KEY=<your-api-key>   # see "Manual API key export" above
poly init
```

`poly init` creates a local directory and pulls the full project configuration. From there the standard `poly status` / `poly push` / `poly pull` workflow applies.

---

## Per-region API keys

If you work across multiple regions, you can set region-scoped environment variables. The ADK checks the credential file first, then region-scoped env vars, then `POLY_ADK_KEY`.

| Region | Environment variable |
|---|---|
| `us-1` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_US` |
| `euw-1` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_EUW` |
| `uk-1` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_UK` |
| `studio` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_STUDIO` |
| `staging` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_STAGING` |
| `dev` | `POLY_ADK_KEY_DEV` |

```bash
export POLY_ADK_KEY_US=<your-us-api-key>
export POLY_ADK_KEY=<your-fallback-api-key>   # used for any other region
```
