title: What is the PolyAI ADK?
description: Learn what the PolyAI Agent Development Kit is, why it exists, and how it supports local development workflows for Agent Studio.
---

The **PolyAI ADK (Agent Development Kit)** is a **CLI tool and Python package** for managing **Agent Studio** projects on your local machine.

It gives you a Git-like workflow for synchronizing project configuration between your local filesystem and the Agent Studio platform.

!!! note "The ADK manages configuration files — it does not run your agent"
    The ADK handles pulling, editing, validating, and pushing project configuration between your local machine and Agent Studio. Agent execution — processing calls, running conversations — happens entirely inside Agent Studio. There is no local runtime.

## What you can do with the ADK

- Build and edit Agent Studio projects locally using standard tooling
- Synchronize project configuration with Agent Studio using `poly push` and `poly pull`
- Branch, validate, and review changes before deployment
- Edit and navigate projects in **VS Code** or **Cursor** with the [PolyAI ADK extension](../reference/tooling.md#polyai-adk-extension-for-vs-code-and-cursor), or pair the ADK with [AI coding agents](../reference/tooling.md#claude-code) such as **Claude Code**
- Collaborate across multiple developers on the same project

## Why it exists

The ADK moves most build-and-edit work out of the browser and into your local environment. You can [merge branches](../reference/branch_merge.md) and run reviews from the CLI, while Agent Studio remains the home for deployment and production monitoring — but you no longer have to edit resources there by hand.

Instead of editing everything directly inside Agent Studio, you pull a project locally, make changes using your normal tools, and push those changes back to the platform.

This makes it straightforward to:

- edit resources in your own editor, with the tooling you already use
- collaborate across a team without overwriting each other's work
- validate and review changes before pushing them live
- automate repetitive build work with coding tools

## Multi-developer workflows

The ADK supports team workflows out of the box. See [multi-user workflows and guardrails](../concepts/multi-user-and-guardrails.md) for details on branching, validation, and review.

It preserves the same guardrails as Agent Studio, so developers cannot push changes that are incompatible with the project.

!!! tip "Git-like, but for Agent Studio"

    Think of the ADK as the local development layer for Agent Studio: pull, edit locally, validate, and push.
