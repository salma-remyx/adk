A CLI and Python package for managing [Agent Studio](https://studio.us.poly.ai) projects locally. It provides a Git-like workflow for synchronizing project configurations between your local filesystem and the Agent Studio platform.

**[Documentation](https://polyai.github.io/adk/)**

## Installation

```bash
pip install polyai-adk
```

Once installed, use the `poly` command to manage your projects:

```bash
poly start      # Create an account, access token and new project
poly init       # Initialize a project
poly project    # Manage poly projects
poly pull       # Pull latest configuration
poly push       # Push local changes
poly status     # View project status
poly diff       # View local changes
poly branch     # Manage branches
poly format     # Format resources
poly validate   # Validate configuration
poly review     # Create a review gist
poly deployments  # Manage deployments
poly docs       # Output reference documentation
```

## Usage

Install the ADK from PyPI:

```bash
pip install polyai-adk
```

Once installed, the `poly` CLI command becomes available.

```bash
poly init         # Initialize a project (interactive)
poly pull         # Pull latest configuration
poly push         # Push local changes
poly status       # View project status
poly diff         # View local changes
poly branch       # Manage branches
poly format       # Format resources
poly validate     # Validate configuration
poly review       # Create a review gist
poly deployments  # List deployment history
```

Run:

```bash
poly --help
```

to see all available commands.

Each command also supports `--help` for detailed syntax:

```bash
poly push --help
```

## Commands

Run `poly --help` to see all available commands and options. Each command also supports `--help` for detailed syntax (e.g. `poly push --help`).

### `poly init`

Initialize a new Agent Studio project locally. Runs interactively by default, prompting for region, account, and project. You can also pass these directly:

```bash
poly init
poly init --region us-1 --account_id 123 --project_id my_project
poly init --base-path /path/to/projects
poly init --format   # format resources after init
```

### `poly pull`

Pull the latest project configuration from Agent Studio:

```bash
poly pull
poly pull --force     # overwrite all local changes
poly pull --format    # format resources after pulling
```

### `poly push`

Push local changes to Agent Studio:

```bash
poly push
poly push --dry-run          # preview what would be pushed
poly push --skip-validation  # skip local validation before pushing
poly push --force            # overwrite remote changes
poly push --format           # format resources before pushing
```

### `poly status`

View changed, new, and deleted files in your project:

```bash
poly status
```

### `poly diff`

Show diffs between your local project and the remote version, or between two named versions:

```bash
poly diff                              # local vs remote (all changes)
poly diff --files file1.yaml           # specific files only
poly diff abc1234                      # version hash vs its predecessor
poly diff --before hash1 --after hash2 # compare two specific versions
```

### `poly revert`

Revert local changes:

```bash
poly revert                        # revert all changes
poly revert file1.yaml file2.yaml  # revert specific files
```

### `poly branch`

Manage branches (default branch is `main`):

```bash
poly branch list
poly branch current
poly branch create my-feature
poly branch switch my-feature
poly branch switch my-feature --force  # discard uncommitted changes
```

### `poly format`

Format project resources (Python via ruff, YAML/JSON via in-process formatting). Use `--check` to only report files that would change; use `--ty` to also run type checking.

```bash
poly format                        # all resources
poly format --files file1.py       # specific files
poly format --check                # check only, no writes
```

### `poly validate`

Validate project configuration locally:

```bash
poly validate
```

### `poly review`

Create a GitHub gist for reviewing changes, similar to a pull request:

```bash
poly review create                                        # local vs remote
poly review create abc1234                                # version hash vs its predecessor
poly review create --before hash1 --after hash2           # compare two specific versions
poly review create --before main --after feature-branch   # compare branches
poly review list                                          # list existing review gists
poly review delete                                        # delete all review gists
```

### `poly deployments`

List deployment history for the project:

```bash
poly deployments                          # last 10 sandbox deployments
poly deployments --env live               # live environment
poly deployments --limit 20 --offset 10   # pagination
poly deployments --hash abc1234           # start from a specific version
poly deployments --details                # full metadata per deployment
```

### `poly chat`

Start an interactive chat session with your agent:

```bash
poly chat
poly chat --environment live
poly chat --channel webchat
poly chat --metadata   # show functions, flows, and state each turn
```

### `poly docs`

Output ADK documentation
```bash
poly docs
poly docs -all
poly docs {documentation (e.g topics)}
poly docs --output doc_file.md
```
